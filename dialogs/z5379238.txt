Week 1:
This week marked the formation of our project group.
Together, we delved into a lively discussion to determine our project preferences, aligning our interests and skills.
Personally, I embarked on a journey to acquire knowledge in front-end development,
dedicating time to online tutorials and resources to build a solid foundation for the tasks ahead.

Week 2:
A significant milestone was the creation of our GitHub repository, setting the stage for collaborative development.
Additionally, we had an insightful session with our client, gaining valuable perspective on their expectations.
Over the weekend, the team convened to deliberate on the project's direction and draft the initial proposal.
My contribution included articulating user stories and establishing the framework for our upcoming sprints.

Week 3:
The team gathered to refine our proposal, ensuring it met the project's objectives and our client's vision.
We launched our first sprint on Tuesday, with a clear agenda and well-defined tasks.
Throughout the week, each team member meticulously reviewed the proposal, leading to a consensus.
We submitted the finalized proposal on Friday, confident in our collective effort.

Week 4:
This week, my focus was on developing the profile page.
I successfully completed the front-end component, creating an intuitive and responsive design.
Additionally, I developed a preliminary dashboard demonstration tailored for three distinct user roles,
showcasing the interface's versatility and potential.

Week 5:
My attention remained on the profile page, where I implemented enhancements and resolved several bugs,
particularly in the profile update functionalities. These refinements were crucial in improving the user experience and ensuring reliability.

Week 7:
I shifted my focus towards the messaging and application features of our platform.
This entailed developing the application pages, which would serve as a crucial touchpoint for users,
and integrating a status toggle feature to streamline the application process.

Week 8:
Continuing with the application features, I dedicated this week to enhancing the application pages and perfecting the status toggle function.
I also revisited previous pages to debug and improve, such as the profile update and the tutor admin page, ensuring logical consistency and user-friendliness.

Week 9:
This week was dedicated to the notification functionalities, a key aspect of user engagement on the platform.
Alongside this, I systematically addressed and resolved bugs from previous pages, enhancing stability and performance across the platform.
